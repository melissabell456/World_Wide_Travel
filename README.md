# Wide World Travel Guides, Factories, Routes

### This is a combination of exercises with NSS for practice using AngularJS. 
### Requirements
..* For this project you need to use Angular to list a collection of travel guides in the DOM. Build an application that has one view, and one controller that will be responsible for retrieving the data and exposing it for use in the view. The view needs to list all book titles, which type of book it is, and the price for the book.
..* Fetch your data using an http call that returns a promise. Save the returned data as a property of the $scope object and loop through it to display the guidebook info to the user
..* Post MVP, added in additional filtering options for practice (search by name, sort by price, and radio buttons to toggle types)
